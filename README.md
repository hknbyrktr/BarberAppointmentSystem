# BarberAppointment

# 💈 Unity Barber Appointment System

This project is a **barbershop appointment system** built using **Unity** for the front-end and **MySQL + PHP** for the back-end.
I did the front-end (Unity) of this project given by our university professor, my friend did the back-end (MySQL). I did PHP with GPT :)
Of course there are deficiencies in this project that we did in about a week. You can reach the details below or by downloading. Good luck.

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Unity (C#)
- PHP (for backend API)

## 🚀 How to Run
### 1. Backend (PHP & MySQL)

1. Install **XAMPP** and start Apache + MySQL.
2. Place the `/api` folder inside `htdocs`.
3. Import `berberrandevusistemi.sql` into phpMyAdmin to create the database.

### 2. Frontend (Unity)

1. Open `/BarberAppointment` in Unity Editor.
